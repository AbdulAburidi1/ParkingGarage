The maximum charge for any given         day is $12.00.  All cars are gone by midnight.  Write a program to         calculate and print a summary of the charges for a day.  For input         the program will read the hours of usage for each of the 5 cars.  The program         will print the result, as shown below.         */        double car1, car2, car3, car4, car5, Total1, hour, i, Total2, Total3, Total4, Total5;        double totalhours, totalcharge, H;        String pattern = "00.0";        String pattern1 = "$00.00";        DecimalFormat df, df1;        df = new DecimalFormat(pattern);        df1 = new DecimalFormat(pattern1);        System.out.print("Enter the hours parked for car 1: ");        car1 = input.nextDouble();        System.out.print("Enter the hours parked for car 2: ");        car2 = input.nextDouble();        System.out.print("Enter the hours parked for car 3: ");        car3 = input.nextDouble();        System.out.print("Enter the hours parked for car 4: ");        car4 = input.nextDouble();        System.out.print("Enter the hours parked for car 5: ");        car5 = input.nextDouble();        hour = 2;        i = 5;        H = 12;        {            if (car1 > hour)                Total1 = Math.ceil(car1) + i - hour;            else                Total1 = i;            if (car2 > hour)                Total2 = Math.ceil(car2) + i - hour;            else                Total2 = i;            if (car3 > hour)                Total3 = Math.ceil(car3) + i - hour;            else                Total3 = i;            if (car4 > hour)                Total4 = Math.ceil(car4) + i - hour;            else                Total4 = i;            if (car5 > hour)                Total5 = Math.ceil(car5) + i - hour;            else                Total5 = i;        }        if (Total1 > H)            Total1 = 12;        if (Total2 > H)            Total2 = 12;        if (Total3 > H)            Total3 = 12;        if (Total4 > H)            Total4 = 12;        if (Total5 > H)            Total5 = 12;        totalhours = car1 + car2 + car3 + car4 + car5;        totalcharge = Total1 + Total2 + Total3 + Total4 + Total5;		        System.out.println("");        System.out.println("Total Hours " + df.format(totalhours));        System.out.println("Total Charge  " + df1.format(totalcharge));    }}
